AI-Based Program Visualizer

Project Overview

The AI-Based Program Visualizer is an innovative tool designed to dynamically visualize code execution using artificial intelligence. It helps programmers, educators, and students understand the flow of programs by generating real-time visual representations of code execution.

Features

Code Parsing and Execution Tracking: Analyzes source code and tracks execution flow.

Graphical Representation: Converts program logic into an easy-to-understand visual format.

AI-Powered Suggestions: Provides intelligent insights and optimizations.

Multi-Language Support: Works with Python, Java, C++, and more.

Interactive Debugging: Allows step-by-step execution with real-time visualization.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

OpenAI API (for AI-based analysis)

Matplotlib & NetworkX (for graphical visualization)

PyGraphviz (for generating execution flow diagrams)

Flask (for web-based visualization interface)

Hardware Requirements:

A system with Python installed

Internet connection for AI model integration

Installation Guide

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-program-visualizer.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd ai-program-visualizer

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python main.py

How It Works

The user inputs code in the visualizer interface.

The AI parses the code and generates an execution flowchart.

The system provides real-time debugging assistance.

Users can step through the code execution with animated visual representations.

Future Enhancements

Integration with IDE plugins for seamless workflow.

Support for real-time collaboration and team-based debugging.

Advanced AI-based error prediction and suggestions.

Mobile and web-based versions for cloud-based visualization.
